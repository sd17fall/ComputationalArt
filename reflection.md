# Reflection
### Emma Westerhoff
When approaching this project, I had an idea of what I wanted the final product to look like.  I took my time getting there to ensure that everything worked first.  For example, when writing the generate_random_function file, my first iteration had an if statement for every possible function name.  Then, after individually adding and testing each new function, I put them into a list and swept through that as I had originally intended.  If I had just started with my end goal, there would have been many places for mistakes to slip through the cracks.

This project was really well scoped, as just a mini-project.  I put in just enough time to do the actual project and the first extension, but rather foolishly thought the other two extensions would take an equal amount of time.  I wish I had set a goal for myself before starting the project as to how far I would go, rather than saying "whatever I have time for".  Surprise, at Olin, you only have time for things that you set aside time for.

Unit testing could have been more documented, as many were done using print statements.  Using doctest would have made it easier for me to go back and see what had, or used to, work.  At the same time, doctests can clutter up my code and make it less legible, so it's all about finding the balance.
