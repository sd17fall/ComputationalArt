    "This project was extremely interesting and fun as we are generating images from ramdon functions we generated. Despite of my limited knowledge on color's organization, I was able to understand the project and gained a little insight on color. This project made a very effective use of recursion. From a process point of view, all doctests went pretty well as I was able to implement unit test and test out each individual function making sure it works. In addition to that, writing the definition of the function itelf is a very fun process. For example, for the remap_interval function, I did the entire math process on paper first, then transform it to computer science. When I was doing the project, I realized that coding is more complex than math as we have to think about many different situations as well as certain conditions, such as base case. Often in times, I do not think of particular scenario that could impact my result. One thing i wish I knew before I started that would helped me succeed was the science on color. I started the project slowly as I was confused by the concept of color. I followed the instructions step by step. If I knew a little more about it, I could just use my own knowledge to write codes to test out my skills. "
