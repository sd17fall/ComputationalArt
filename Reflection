This computational art project was a very intruiging topic for someone passionate about the intersection of art and technology, leading me to successfully create unique art using python.  One thing I did very well during this project was communicating with my classmates about their personal problem-solving techniques.  This is a difficult task for me because I am often too stubborn to ask for help.  However, with this project I felt like I could have conversations about ways to solve a problem (i.e. recursion) without feeling like a specific answer was given to me.  In fact, talking through these things led me to personalized solutions that improved my code.  One thing I could have done better was use doctests.  Since I have python experience already, I often think I do not need to use them when I am very confident in the syntax and completion of my code.  However, I am sure that ignoring this important step of writing code will come back to bite me if I continue coding the way I have been.  This is something I will be sure to focus on in the upcoming mini-project.
I did take the time to complete a Going Beyond portion of this assignment by creating GIFs, but if I had more time, I would definitely love to explore the music pulsator.  It would be a challenge certainly, given the very short time frame the program would need to right visuals.  Currently, my program takes about a half hour to make a 10 second long GIF at 500x500 px and 20 fps.  I'd definitely employ lambda functions and multithreading to increase this speed, but it may take installing a jank version of PyPy for Windows on my computer or running PyPy for Python 2.7 and changing my code to fit that.  Either way, it would be a time consuming process, but a result that give me a large sense of self-accomplishment.  Plus, it would be something I could actually use on a day-to-day basis, which would be even more satisfying.
